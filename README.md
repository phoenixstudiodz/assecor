# Frontend test Assecor-GmbH
- the application runs and shows data of the selected API
- there are atleast 3 consumed API root resources
- you have used an application framework (Angular 2+, Blazor, Vue)
- ~~the application uses responsive design and scales properly woth changing screen sizes/resolutions~~ 
- the code is under source control (Git, TFS, DevOps)

## Note 
- The code is not 100% perfect (but all required features are there) this is what I can do for now, working more on it and make it responsive is an easy task but it will require me to use imagination and will be time consuming. 
- There is some copy past from Movie Page to People Page (variable naming), and I am aware of that
- I don't have more time to spent on the test, Thank you for your understanding.
